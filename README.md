# discord-nuke-bot
A basic discord nuke bot made with discord.js v13
# DISCLAIMER: Use this at your own risk - I'm not responsible for you getting into trouble and stuff.

# What this bot does
- Delete all the channels in a server
- Makes a ton of new channels & spams in them
- Attempts to spam user DMs
- Unbans everyone
- Logs invites to that server

# Commands
- "start" to start
- "stop" to stop
- "cleanup" to clean up the server
- "leave" to leave the server (owner only)

# How to use
1. Download the code of course, or copy and paste it onto a site like repl.it
2. Change the bottom last line of code to include your bot token inbetween the 2 speech marks
E.g. if my token was "abcdefg12345" the bottom last line would look like this:

`client.login("abcdefg12345")`
